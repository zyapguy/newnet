# New Net
It's a weird project, don't ask. 

# What is this
It's a way of requesting VERY simple websites without getting tracked

# Where is the Code??
This is a way of storing the websites. The actual code is only usable by people who have it.

# Why?
- Why not
- Why are you asking

- Go out and live your life
- Actually don't do that
- Stay Home!
